    "- Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines the penalties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods. It aims to address some of the limitations of each technique by simultaneously penalizing the absolute size of the coefficients  and the squared size of the coefficients."
